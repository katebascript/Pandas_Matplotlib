# 📊 Python Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`data_analysis_assignment.ipynb`) demonstrating a comprehensive data analysis and visualization workflow using Python's **pandas** and **matplotlib** libraries. The project focuses on the classic Iris dataset to showcase key data science concepts.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary goals of this project are:
- To load and explore a dataset using the **pandas** library.
- To perform basic data analysis and derive meaningful insights.
- To create various plots and charts using the **matplotlib** and **seaborn** libraries to visualize data distributions and relationships.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `data_analysis_assignment.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing all the code and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## 🚀 How to Run the Notebook

To run the notebook and replicate the analysis, you'll need to have a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter

🔍 Key Steps in the Analysis
Task 1: Data Loading and Exploration
The Iris dataset is loaded directly from sklearn.datasets.

We explore the dataset's structure using .head() and .info() to check for data types and missing values. The dataset is found to be clean, with no missing data.

Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
We compute descriptive statistics (.describe()) to understand the distribution of numerical features.

Data is grouped by species to calculate the mean of each feature, revealing significant differences between the three Iris species.

Task 3: Data Visualization
Line Chart: Illustrates the average sepal length across different species.

Bar Chart: Compares the average petal length for each species.

Histogram: Visualizes the distribution of sepal width.

Scatter Plot: Displays the relationship between sepal length and petal length, showing a clear distinction between the species.

💡 Findings and Observations
Petal Length and Petal Width are the most effective features for distinguishing between the three species of Iris flowers.

There is a strong positive correlation between sepal length and petal length.

The average measurements of virginica are consistently larger than those of versicolor and setosa.
